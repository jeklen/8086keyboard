I am writting an assembly program for 8086.I need to have a time delay which must be 1 sec.I thought something like that:

AGAIN2:  MOV DI,01ADH
AGAIN:    MOV BP,FFFFH
              NOP   ;(3 CYCLES)
              NOP   ;(3 CYCLES)
              NOP   ;(3 CYCLES)
              DEC BP  ;(2 CYCLES)
              JNZ AGAIN   ;(i am assuming it is 5 CYCLES)
              DEC DI
              JNZ AGAIN  


Is that code right?Will it be a delay of a second?

Is there any way to make this delay using the RTC clock of my PC?


It can be delay of one second. Maybe less, maybe more. It depends on your CPU speed.
The proper way is to read clock tickes with the help of INT 1Ah:
  MOV AH, 0
  INT 1Ah
  CX <- High clock word
  DX <- Low clock word
  For a second you need to count ~ 18 ticks

So code can be something like this:
  MOV DI, 18
  MOV AH, 0
  INT 1Ah
  MOV BX, DX
Delay:
  MOV AH, 0
  INT 1Ah
  SUB DX, BX
  CMP DI, DX
  JA Delay

Note: You need to think about the case when "first" DX will be bigger than new one...




What i finally ended up using was the nop loop

; start delay

mov bp, 43690
mov si, 43690
delay2:
dec bp
nop
jnz delay2
dec si
cmp si,0    
jnz delay2
; end delay
I used two registers which I set them both to any high value and its gonna keep on looping until both values go to zero

What I used here was AAAA for both SI and BP, i ended up with roughly 1 second for each delay loop.

Thanks for the help guys, and yes, we still use MS DOS for this assembly language course :(

Set 1 million microseconds interval (1 second) By using below instruction .

MOV     CX, 0FH
MOV     DX, 4240H
MOV     AH, 86H
INT     15H
You can set multiple second delay by using 86H and INT 15H

check these links for more details

Waits a specified number of microseconds before returning control to the caller

INT 15H 86H: Wait
